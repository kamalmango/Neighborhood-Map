To run the Neighborhood Map web application, open index.html in a web browser. 

The application features a map of the Washington DC area and displays 20 key locations with photos and information about those places taken from the yelp API. 

The search bar can be used to filter the results by name. Accessing more information about a location can be done by clicking on the result in the list view or clicking the marker on the map. 

Hovering over a marker changes it's color and hovering over a list item changes that list item's color as well as it's respective markers color. Clicking on the Places button on the top right makes the list disappear and reappear.
